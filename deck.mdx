# state management in js is hard

<Notes>

- many many solutions
- redux, react state/context, flux
- apollo local state is one of those solutions

</Notes>

---

# why state management in the frontend is needed at all?

---

# hasn't this been solved with other libs like react context and redux?

* yes
  * if using it already and loving it, no reason to switch
  * if adopting graphql, then seriously consider switching

---

# apollo local state to the rescue!

    <h1>Sort of...</h1>

# Pros

- [considerably less code than in redux](https://blog.apollographql.com/reducing-our-redux-code-with-react-apollo-5091b9de9c2a)
- components only ask for the data they need
- entire data graph is strongly-typed
    - not like this in redux, you have to recreate it yourself
    - The data models and store structure can be shared between the data fetching cache and the local state management cache
- very easy to adopt if using apollo client already
    - if already using graphql yes, already using apollo client, yes x 100
        - almost zero extra config if already using apollo client
    - Actions are performed with mutations, something that previous GraphQL users already understand
    - Staying within the Apollo ecosystem meant smooth integration with existing tools, meaning less overhead for developers.
    - funded project (apollo) means docs, support and plenty of eyes on the projects

---

# Cons

- making many many mutations sucks super hard
- show boilerplate heavy mutation
- needed something better

---

This component renders an input which allows a user to rename a Github issue.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const IssueContainer: React.FC<{ issue: GithubIssue }> = ({ issue }) => {
    const updateIssuename = useMutation(UPDATE_ISSUE_NAME);
    return <input
        onChange={name => {
            updateIssuename({
                variables: {
                    input: {
                        id: issue.id,
                        name
                    }
                }
            });
        }}
    />
};
```

---

And the mutation definition:

```typescript
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { IFieldResolver } from 'graphql-tools';
import { Mutation } from 'react-apollo';

import { ISSUE_PARTS as issueQueryFragments } from '../flows';
import { IssueStepParts, UpdateIssuename, UpdateIssueNameVariables } from '../../graphql-types';
import { ResolverContext } from '.';

export const QUERY = gql`
  mutation UpdateIssueName($input: UpdateIssueNameInput!) {
    pdateIssueName(input: $input) @client
  }
`;

export class UpdateIssueNameMutation extends Mutation<UpdateIssueName, UpdateIssueNameVariables> {}

const updateIssuename: IFieldResolver<void, ResolverContext, any> = (
  _obj,
  args: UpdateIssueNameVariables,
  context,
) => {
  const { input } = args;
  const { cache, getCacheKey } = context;

    // 1. Get the id of the object in the cache using the actual issue id
  const id = getCacheKey({ __typename: 'Issue', id: input.id });
  const fragment = gql`
    ${issueQueryFragments}
    fragment IssueParts on Issue {
      id
      name
    }
  `;
    // 2. Get the data from the cache
  const step: IssueParts | null = cache.readFragment({
    fragment,
    fragmentName: 'IssueParts',
    id,
  });
  if (!issue) {
    return null;
  }

  // 3. Update the data locally
  const updateIssue = {
    ...issue,
    name: input.name,
  };

  // 4. Write the data back to the cache
  cache.writeFragment({
    fragment,
    fragmentName: 'IssueParts',
    id,
    data: updatedStep,
  });
  return null;
};

export default updateIssuename;
```

---

You can see why writing many of these would become a problem.

# Needed to fix it

* The pros were just TOO good to give up

---

Let's take our inspiration from Redux.

- this resulted in us making many many mutations
- lots of boilerplate and testing was not easy, very terse and prone to error
- way too much code for such small manipulations to data
- we need something better
- this was not as bad in redux
- why though?

---

whats the solution to this?

* show new createResolver in action

---

[Hugh Wilson of the Apollo team has said they are looking to improve it.](https://spectrum.chat/apollo/apollo-link-state/apollo-link-state-vs-redux-vs-react-hooks-context~dcb1118c-8819-4593-8b22-040229ed4282?m=MTU1MTM3ODkzNjcxNg==)


Maybe one day I'll make a pr to get this sort of feature in who knows.
