<Notes>

* form wizard, built probably by many of you
- prime candidate, not our flow editor
- implemting a ui like this is tough, need state management lib
- components need to share data
- e.g. input something in one node here, another component needs to change
- e.g. network calls would be expensive, user needs to do work without saving all of the time

- complex single page apps which have a combination of remote data and local data are a great candidate for ALS
- difficult problem but many many solutions
  - e.g. redux, react state/context, flux
  - apollo local state is one of those solutions

### Why use a state management library?

</div>

</Split>

### What if we want to use GraphQL?

<Appear>
  <h3>What if we want to use Apollo Client?</h3>
  <h3>Another state management library?</h3>
</Appear>

<Notes>

* react state is very primitive
  * doesnt work at scale
  * great for state held within a component
* different components need to know state of each other
* need to be updated when another component is updated
* in a fashionable and of course maintanable way

</Notes>

---

## Apollo Local State! But first ...

---

## Apollo Client

<Appear>

  * Pre-req to Apollo Local State
  * A GraphQL Javascript Client
  * Query and Mutate Remote Data from a GraphQL API
  * A Network Cache (<strong>important!</strong>)

</Appear>

<Notes>

- if you are building a frontend you are likely already usig graphql and also using apollo client
- apollo client lets you query and mutate remote data on a graphql api
- has a built-in cache which has enables some pretty awesome features
  * e.g. blah blah blah
* this is how apollo client gives you a lot of nice features like different fetch policies

</Notes>

---

### Network Cache

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dscgr6mcw/image/upload/v1574881631/apollo-state-talk/1_CbevjJN6IQBk7gbh38V-2g.png" height="75%" width="70%" />

<Notes>

* do a request, its in the cache
* one part of the cache is updated,
* all components which are querying that part of the cache will be updated

</Notes>

---

### Network Cache === <strong>Local State Cache</strong>

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dscgr6mcw/image/upload/v1574881631/apollo-state-talk/1_CbevjJN6IQBk7gbh38V-2g.png" height="75%" width="70%" />

<Notes>

* this is where apollo local state comes in
* instead of duplicating the cache/store where your client side state will live
  * might as well use the same one amirite
* instead of bringing in another state management library like Redux so the Apollo cache can be a single source of truth.
* meaning your network cache is the same exact thing as your local state cache

</Notes>

---

## My Experience

<Notes>

* lets go into apollo local states pros and cons
* these are the big ones from my experience
* are some more on both sides that i dont mention
* my talk so I get to talk about what I want

# Pro

## It's GraphQL ‚öõÔ∏è

* Typesafe
* Query/Mutations
* Schema

<Notes>

pro:

* data manipulations upon the local state cache are performed with mutations,
something that previous GraphQL users already understand
* fragments
* lingo is the same

</Notes>

---

# Pro

## It's Apollo üîÆ

* One normalized cache
* Funded
* One ecosystem

<Notes>

* having one cache for both network/local is very powerful
- Staying within the Apollo ecosystem meant smooth integration with existing tools, meaning less overhead for developers.
- almost zero extra config if already using apollo client
- very similar to how you query/mutate remote data
- apollo dev tools

</Notes>

---

# Con

## Dev Experience üöÇ

* Hard to test
* Boilerplate (e.g. resolvers)

<Notes>

- because one action per reducer, means mutations can have a lot of code
- a lot of code, means a lot of testing

</Notes>

## Let's do an example üè´

## E.g. Editing a Github Issue name üñäÔ∏è

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dscgr6mcw/image/upload/v1574737880/apollo-state-talk/issuenameinput.png" height="25%" width="90%" />

<Notes>

* here is am example of editing a model that may appear in the cache
  * an issue name, in the app, github
* this data was likely loaded from the remote graphql api at some point
* that means it is in the cache for us to manipulate

* simple example just used to make the understanding of apollo local state easier
  * probably would use something like react-state for this

</Notes>

<CodeSurfer>

```jsx file=./components/IssueInput.tsx subtitle="Example React Component" title="IssueInput.tsx"
```

```diff 3:7 subtitle="Define the mutation"
```

```diff 5[36:43] subtitle="New directive!"
```

```diff 12,16:25 subtitle="Use the mutation"
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

* define the mutation 
* looks similar to remote grapqhl api mutation

* use enters new value in the input
* client side mutation is run
* updates the cache
* which makes the queries on issue name run again
* thus updating all parts of your app where issue name is

</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```graphql subtitle="Define client-side schema" title="clientOnly.graphql"
extend type Mutation {
  # A mutation which edits the name on a Github Issue.
  editGithubIssue(input: EditGithubIssueInput!): Boolean
}

input EditGithubIssueInput {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

```diff 1[1:6] subtitle="Apollo Client will merge this schema with the remote one"
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

* very familar to people who have worked with graphql apis
* notice the extend statement on the type from the server type
* apollo client will merge the schemas

</Notes>

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

* next the resolver which handles actually mutating the cache data
* Goes to show the dev experience here is lacking
* this is how to do it, straight from the docs
* Ts makes this worse but I havent wrote regular JS in almost two years

<Notes>

* just like ellen, i was disgusted
* repeat this for every mutation
* This was not as bad in redux
* Not much boilerplate
* Was easy to test
* in redux, you defined an action and wrote the resolver which:
  * was usually small 
  * easily testable

</Notes>

---

## üî¥ The cons are starting to show üî¥

### And this is a simple resolver...

<Notes>

- because one action per reducer, means mutations can have a lot of code
* way too much code which could go wrong or devs forgetting to do things
* to test this you need a fake store and perform fake mutation on it
* hard to test
  * lots of use of external apis

</Notes>

---

After some ü§î and many mutations ‚úçÔ∏è ...

<Notes>

* what we came up with which made the whole process a lot more simple
* we started to see some patterns

##### With this new utility function, it covered about 90% of our use cases.

<Notes>

* assumption you are writing data in the same format you read it
* way less chance for mess ups
* more complex mutations that need data from elsewhere can opt-out
* became an even better experience
* very easy to test these reducers

Recap üìö

* Learned about Apollo Local State and how it relates to GraphQL/Apollo Client
* Used inspiration from Redux, e.t.c. to make the experience much better
